This project aims to register studies of graph and search algorithms. These are some Computer  Science intermediate themes requested for the second part of **Google** Software Engineer role interview which i am super excited and honered to participate.

Even if the professionals from Google engineering team that will validate my skills decide that they won't hire me, at least this may be a great study case to be registered here and serving to hone my alorithmic skills.
